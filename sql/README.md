Here I list down the constraints/foreign key that should be added as they are still missing in the schema.
Schema:

Entity Tables:
1. Publication(primary key: publication_id)
2. Author(primary key: author_id)
3. Publisher(primary key: publisher_id)

Relation:
Many-to-one:
  1.  Publication >-- published by -- Publisher
      [i.e. each publication have at most 1 publisher]
      FOREIGN KEY: Publication(publisher_id) REFERENCES Publisher(publisher_id)

Many-to-Many:
  1. Publication >-- authored by --< Author
     Relation table: PublicationAuthor(publication_id, author_id)
     CONSTRAINT: (publication_id, author_id) should be PRIMARY KEY
     FOREIGN KEY:
       - PublicationAuthor(publication_id) REFERENCES Publication(publication_id)
       - PubliationAuthor(author_id) REFERENCES Author(author_id)
  2. Publication >--edited by--< Author
     Relation table: PublicationEditor(publication_id, editor_id)
     CONSTRAINT: (publication_id, editor_id) should be PRIMARY KEY
     FOREIGN KEY:
       - PublicationEditor(publication_id) REFERENCES Publication(publication_id)
       - PublicationEditor(editor_id) REFERENCES Author(author_id)
  3. Publication >--cites--< Publication
     Relation table: Citation(publication_id, citation_id)
     CONSTRAINT:
       - (publication_id, citation_id) should be PRIMARY KEY
       - publication_id != citation_id
     FOREIGN KEY:
       - Citation(publication_id) REFERENCES Publication(publication_id)
       - Citation(citation_id) REFERENCES Publication(publication_id)

Multivalued attributes:
  1. Publication has 0 to many url
      Table: PublicationUrl(publication_id, url)
      FOREIGN KEY:
        - PublicationUrl(publication_id) REFERENCES Publication(publication_id)
  2. Publication has 0 to many notes
      Table: PublicationNote(publication_id, note)
      FOREIGN KEY:
        - PublicationNote(publication_id) REFERENCES Publication(publication_id)
  3. Publication has 0 to many ISBN
      Table: PublicationISBN(publication_id, isbn)
      FOREIGN KEY:
        - PublicationISBN(publication_id) REFERENCES Publication(publication_id)

Additional constraint that I know will take a long time to execute, so we'll try to do this later when we have done the rest of the stuff:
- ALTER TABLE Publication ADD UNIQUE (key)
